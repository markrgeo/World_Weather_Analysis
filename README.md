# World_Weather_Analysis

The Module 6 Challenge is comprised of three parts.

The Weather_Database which includes code that pulls weather information from an API.

The Vacation_Search which begins to focus in on particular data from the weather API and includes code which joins this information with mapping code.

The Vacation_Itinerary creates a travel plan based around data from the previous two deliverables and creates a travel plan using the mapping potential from the Geoapify Routing API.
